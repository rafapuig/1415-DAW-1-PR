* When the event accessors are merely relays for another class that is broadcasting
the event.

• When the class exposes a large number of events, where most of the time very
few subscribers exist, such as a Windows control. In such cases, it is better to
store the subscriber’s delegate instances in a dictionary, since a dictionary will
contain less storage overhead than dozens of null delegate field references.

• When explicitly implementing an interface that declares an event.
